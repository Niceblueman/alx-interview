# Minimum Operations

## Description
This Python module provides a method `minOperations(n)` that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in a text file. The two allowed operations are Copy All and Paste.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- Files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should be documented
- Code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

## Files
- `0-minoperations.py`: Contains the implementation of the `minOperations` method.
- `0-main.py`: Main file for testing the `minOperations` method.

## Usage
To test the implementation, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
./0-main.py
```

## Example
```python
n = 4
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

n = 12
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
```

This will output:
```bash
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
```
